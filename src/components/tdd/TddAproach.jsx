      <p>TDD training emphasizes a test-first approach, where developers write tests before implementing functionality. It teaches the process of writing small, automated tests to validate code, driving the development process and ensuring code correctness, reliability, and maintainability. By combining these trainings, professionals gain the skills to design scalable architectures, apply best practices through patterns, and build high-quality software through a disciplined and test-driven development approach.
